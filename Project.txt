Questions for the programming session:

part for handling missing filename, height or width
or invalid input. can it be done by HTML or must it
be error handling in the backend?

ans/ can be both, mainly HTML

and should there be a limit for resize because
if the resized picture is too big, it will take
a lot of space in the webpage

ans/ you can, but I will make it a suggestion
rather than a must.

should the resized image replace the old one or not?

ans/ as I like

Multer doesn't allow same pictures to 
upload again on its own,
so how am I supposed to handle or do that?

ans/ I have to because multer replaces the file
and that slows down everything.

Things to do:-
- Add check if the file already exists and stop
everything from continuing if it does.  Check!
- Return an API URL of the uploaded or resized
image after it gets uploaded or resized. Check!
API URL example: /localhost:3000/myPictures/Fushigiro.jpg
- Error handling for everything and send 200 status Check!
- Unit Testing!! Check!

Improvements:
- Accept other image formats than JPG
- console logging everything!!
- Add comments
- Write README Check
- Move gallery js file to front folder
